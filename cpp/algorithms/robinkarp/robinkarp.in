THE BOY WHO LIVED r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you°Ød expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn°Øt hold with such nonsense. Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. M CHAPTER ONE .. 2 .. They didn°Øt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley°Øs sister, but they hadn°Øt met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn°Øt have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn°Øt want Dudley mixing with a child like that. When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. °∞Little tyke,°± chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four°Øs drive. It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar °™ a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn°Øt realize what he had seen °™ then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner THE BOY WHO LIVED .. 3 .. of Privet Drive, but there wasn°Øt a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive °™ no, looking at the sign; cats couldn°Øt read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn°Øt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn°Øt bear people who dressed in funny clothes °™ the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren°Øt young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt °™ these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn°Øt, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn°Øt see the owls swoop CHAPTER ONE .. 4 .. ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he°Ød stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. He°Ød forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker°Øs. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn°Øt know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn°Øt see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. °∞The Potters, that°Øs right, that°Øs what I heard °™°± °∞°™ yes, their son, Harry °™°± Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn°Øt such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn°Øt even sure his nephew was called Harry. He°Ød never even seen the boy. ItTHE BOY WHO LIVED .. 5 .. might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn°Øt blame her °™ if he°Ød had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . . He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o°Øclock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. °∞Sorry,°± he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn°Øt seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, °∞Don°Øt be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!°± And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off. Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn°Øt approve of imagination. As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw °™ and it didn°Øt improve his mood °™ was the tabby cat he°Ød spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. °∞Shoo!°± said Mr. Dursley loudly. CHAPTER ONE .. 6 .. The cat didn°Øt move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door°Øs problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (°∞Won°Øt!°±). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: °∞And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation°Øs owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.°± The newscaster allowed himself a grin. °∞Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?°± °∞Well, Ted,°± said the weatherman, °∞I don°Øt know about that, but it°Øs not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they°Øve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early °™ it°Øs not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.°± Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . . THE BOY WHO LIVED .. 7 .. Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He°Ød have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. °∞Er °™ Petunia, dear °™ you haven°Øt heard from your sister lately, have you?°± As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn°Øt have a sister. °∞No,°± she said sharply. °∞Why?°± °∞Funny stuff on the news,°± Mr. Dursley mumbled. °∞Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of first. After a few minutes he stammered, °∞What does it mean, they await my owl?°± °∞Gallopin°Ø Gorgons, that reminds me,°± said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse, and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl °™ a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl °™ a long quill, and a roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down: Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter. Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather°Øs horrible. Hope you°Øre well. Hagrid Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone. Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. °∞Where was I?°± said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight. °∞He°Øs not going,°± he said. Hagrid grunted. °∞I°Ød like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,°± he said. °∞A what?°± said Harry, interested. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS .. 53 .. °∞A Muggle,°± said Hagrid, °∞it°Øs what we call nonmagic folk like them. An°Ø it°Øs your bad luck you grew up in a family o°Ø the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.°± °∞We swore when we took him in we°Ød put a stop to that rubbish,°± said Uncle Vernon, °∞swore we°Ød stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!°± °∞You knew?°± said Harry. °∞You knew I°Øm a °™ a wizard?°± °∞Knew!°± shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. °∞Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that °™ that school °™ and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was °™ a freak! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!°± She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years. °∞Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you°Ød be just the same, just as strange, just as °™ as °™ abnormal °™ and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you!°± Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, °∞Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!°± °∞CAR CRASH!°± roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. °∞How could a car crash kill Lily an°Ø James Potter? It°Øs an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin°Ø his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!°± CHAPTER FOUR .. 54 .. °∞But why? What happened?°± Harry asked urgently. The anger faded from Hagrid°Øs face. He looked suddenly anxious. °∞I never expected this,°± he said, in a low, worried voice. °∞I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin°Ø hold of yeh, how much yeh didn°Øt know. Ah, Harry, I don°Ø know if I°Øm the right person ter tell yeh °™ but someone°Øs gotta °™ yeh can°Øt go off ter Hogwarts not knowin°Ø.°± He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys. °∞Well, it°Øs best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh °™ mind, I can°Øt tell yeh everythin°Ø, it°Øs a great myst°Øry, parts of it. . . .°± He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, °∞It begins, I suppose, with °™ with a person called °™ but it°Øs incredible yeh don°Øt know his name, everyone in our world knows °™°± °∞Who?°± °∞Well °™ I don°Ø like sayin°Ø the name if I can help it. No one does.°± °∞Why not?°± °∞Gulpin°Ø gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .°± Hagrid gulped, but no words came out. °∞Could you write it down?°± Harry suggested. °∞Nah °™ can°Øt spell it. All right °™ Voldemort.°± Hagrid shuddered. °∞Don°Ø make me say it again. Anyway, this °™ this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin°Ø fer followers. Got °Øem, too °™ some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o°Ø his power, °Øcause he was gettin°Ø himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn°Øt THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS .. 55 .. know who ter trust, didn°Øt dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin°Ø over. °ØCourse, some stood up to him °™ an°Ø he killed °Øem. Horribly. One o°Ø the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore°Øs the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn°Øt dare try takin°Ø the school, not jus°Ø then, anyway. °∞Now, yer mum an°Ø dad were as good a witch an°Ø wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an°Ø girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst°Øry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get °Øem on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin°Ø ter do with the Dark Side. °∞Maybe he thought he could persuade °Øem . . . maybe he just wanted °Øem outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an°Ø °™ an°Ø °™°± Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn. °∞Sorry,°± he said. °∞But it°Øs that sad °™ knew yer mum an°Ø dad, an°Ø nicer people yeh couldn°Øt find °™ anyway . . . °∞You-Know-Who killed °Øem. An°Ø then °™ an°Ø this is the real myst°Øry of the thing °™ he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin°Ø by then. But he couldn°Øt do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That°Øs what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh °™ took care of yer mum an°Ø dad an°Ø yer house, even °™ but it didn°Øt work on you, an°Ø that°Øs why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill °Øem, no one except you, an°Ø he°Ød killed some o°Ø the best witches an°Ø wizards CHAPTER FOUR .. 56 .. of the age °™ the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts °™ an°Ø you was only a baby, an°Ø you lived.°± Something very painful was going on in Harry°Øs mind. As Hagrid°Øs story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before °™ and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh. Hagrid was watching him sadly. °∞Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore°Øs orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .°± °∞Load of old tosh,°± said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched. °∞Now, you listen here, boy,°± he snarled, °∞I accept there°Øs something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn°Øt have cured °™ and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world°Øs better off without them in my opinion °™ asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types °™ just what I expected, always knew they°Ød come to a sticky end °™°± But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, °∞I°Øm warning you, Dursley °™ I°Øm warning you °™ one more word . . .°± In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant, Uncle Vernon°Øs courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent. THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS .. 57 .. °∞That°Øs better,°± said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. °∞But what happened to Vol-, sorry °™ I mean, You-Know- Who?°± °∞Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That°Øs the biggest myst°Øry, see . . . he was gettin°Ø more an°Ø more powerful °™ why°Ød he go? °∞Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he°Øs still out there, bidin°Ø his time, like, but I don°Ø believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of °Øem came outta kinda trances. Don°Ø reckon they could°Øve done if he was comin°Ø back. °∞Most of us reckon he°Øs still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. °ØCause somethin°Ø about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin°Ø goin°Ø on that night he hadn°Øt counted on °™ I dunno what it was, no one does °™ but somethin°Ø about you stumped him, all right.°± Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He°Ød spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn°Øt they been turned into warty toads every time they°Ød tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he°Ød once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football? CHAPTER FOUR .. 58 .. °∞Hagrid,°± he said quietly, °∞I think you must have made a mistake. I don°Øt think I can be a wizard.°± To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled. °∞Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?°± Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley°Øs gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he°Ød managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn°Øt he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn°Øt he set a boa constrictor on him? Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming at him. °∞See?°± said Hagrid. °∞Harry Potter, not a wizard °™ you wait, you°Øll be right famous at Hogwarts.°± But Uncle Vernon wasn°Øt going to give in without a fight. °∞Haven°Øt I told you he°Øs not going?°± he hissed. °∞He°Øs going to Stonewall High and he°Øll be grateful for it. I°Øve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish °™ spell books and wands and °™°± °∞If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won°Øt stop him,°± growled Hagrid. °∞Stop Lily an°Ø James Potter°Øs son goin°Ø ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name°Øs been down ever since he was born. He°Øs off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won°Øt know himself. He°Øll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an°Ø he°Øll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled°™°± THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS .. 59 .. °∞I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!°± yelled Uncle Vernon. But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, °∞NEVER °™°± he thundered, °∞°™ INSULT °™ ALBUS °™ DUMBLEDORE °™ IN °™ FRONT °™ OF °™ ME!°± He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley °™ there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig°Øs tail poking through a hole in his trousers. Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them. Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard. °∞Shouldn°Øta lost me temper,°± he said ruefully, °∞but it didn°Øt work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn°Øt much left ter do.°± He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows. °∞Be grateful if yeh didn°Øt mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,°± he said. °∞I°Øm °™ er °™ not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin°Ø. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an°Ø get yer letters to yeh an°Ø stuff °™ one o°Ø the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job °™°± °∞Why aren°Øt you supposed to do magic?°± asked Harry. °∞Oh, well °™ I was at Hogwarts meself but I °™ er °™ got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an°Ø everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.°± CHAPTER FOUR .. 60 .. °∞Why were you expelled?°± °∞It°Øs gettin°Ø late and we°Øve got lots ter do tomorrow,°± said Hagrid loudly. °∞Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an°Ø that.°± He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry. °∞You can kip under that,°± he said. °∞Don°Ø mind if it wriggles a bit, I think I still got a couple o°Ø dormice in one o°Ø the pockets.°± C H A P T E R F I V E .. 61 .. DIAGON ALLEY arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight. °∞It was a dream,°± he told himself firmly. °∞I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I°Øll be at home in my cupboard.°± There was suddenly a loud tapping noise. And there°Øs Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn°Øt open his eyes. It had been such a good dream. Tap. Tap. Tap. °∞All right,°± Harry mumbled, °∞I°Øm getting up.°± He sat up and Hagrid°Øs heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak. H CHAPTER FIVE .. 62 .. Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn°Øt wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid°Øs coat. °∞Don°Øt do that.°± Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat. °∞Hagrid!°± said Harry loudly. °∞There°Øs an owl °™°± °∞Pay him,°± Hagrid grunted into the sofa. °∞What?°± °∞He wants payin°Ø fer deliverin°Ø the paper. Look in the pockets.°± Hagrid°Øs coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets °™ bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins. °∞Give him five Knuts,°± said Hagrid sleepily. °∞Knuts?°± °∞The little bronze ones.°± Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window. Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched. °∞Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an°Ø buy all yer stuff fer school.°± Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture. DIAGON ALLEY .. 63 .. °∞Um °™ Hagrid?°± °∞Mm?°± said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots. °∞I haven°Øt got any money °™ and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won°Øt pay for me to go and learn magic.°± °∞Don°Øt worry about that,°± said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. °∞D°Øyeh think yer parents didn°Øt leave yeh anything?°± °∞But if their house was destroyed °™°± °∞They didn°Ø keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards°Ø bank. Have a sausage, they°Øre not bad cold °™ an°Ø I wouldn°Ø say no teh a bit o°Ø yer birthday cake, neither.°± °∞Wizards have banks?°± °∞Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.°± Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding. °∞Goblins?°± °∞Yeah °™ so yeh°Ød be mad ter try an°Ø rob it, I°Øll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe °™ °Øcept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o°Ø fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.°± Hagrid drew himself up proudly. °∞He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin°Ø you °™ gettin°Ø things from Gringotts °™ knows he can trust me, see. °∞Got everythin°Ø? Come on, then.°± Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm. °∞How did you get here?°± Harry asked, looking around for another boat. CHAPTER FIVE .. 64 .. °∞Flew,°± said Hagrid. °∞Flew?°± °∞Yeah °™ but we°Øll go back in this. Not s°Øpposed ter use magic now I°Øve got yeh.°± They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying. °∞Seems a shame ter row, though,°± said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. °∞If I was ter °™ er °™ speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin°Ø it at Hogwarts?°± °∞Of course not,°± said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land. °∞Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?°± Harry asked. °∞Spells °™ enchantments,°± said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. °∞They say there°Øs dragons guardin°Ø the highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way °™ Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh°Ød die of hunger tryin°Ø ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.°± Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he°Ød never had so many questions in his life. °∞Ministry o°Ø Magic messin°Ø things up as usual,°± Hagrid muttered, turning the page. °∞There°Øs a Ministry of Magic?°± Harry asked, before he could stop himself. °∞ °ØCourse,°± said Hagrid. °∞They wanted Dumbledore fer Minis-DIAGON ALLEY .. 65 .. ter, o°Ø course, but he°Ød never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin°Ø fer advice.°± °∞But what does a Ministry of Magic do?°± °∞Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there°Øs still witches an°Ø wizards up an°Ø down the country.°± °∞Why?°± °∞Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone°Ød be wantin°Ø magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we°Øre best left alone.°± At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone steps onto the street. Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn°Øt blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, °∞See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?°± °∞Hagrid,°± said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, °∞did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?°± °∞Well, so they say,°± said Hagrid. °∞Crikey, I°Ød like a dragon.°± °∞You°Ød like one?°± °∞Wanted one ever since I was a kid °™ here we go.°± They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes°Ø time. Hagrid, who didn°Øt understand °∞Muggle money,°± as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets. People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. °∞Still got yer letter, Harry?°± he asked as he counted stitches. CHAPTER FIVE .. 66 .. Harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket. °∞Good,°± said Hagrid. °∞There°Øs a list there of everything yeh need.°± Harry unfolded a second piece of paper he hadn°Øt noticed the night before, and read: HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY uniform First-year students will require: 1. Three sets of plain work robes (black) 2. One plain pointed hat (black) for day wear 3. One pair of protective gloves (dragon hide or similar) 4. One winter cloak (black, silver fastenings) Please note that all pupils°Ø clothes should carry name tags course books All students should have a copy of each of the following: The Standard Book of Spells (Grade 1) by Miranda Goshawk A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot Magical Theory by Adalbert Waffling A Beginners°Ø Guide to Transfiguration by Emeric Switch One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore Magical Drafts and Potions by Arsenius Jigger DIAGON ALLEY .. 67 ..

Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow. °∞I don°Øt know how the Muggles manage without magic,°± he said as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shops. Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry CHAPTER FIVE .. 68 .. had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn°Øt known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn°Øt help trusting him. °∞This is it,°± said Hagrid, coming to a halt, °∞the Leaky Cauldron. It°Øs a famous place.°± It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn°Øt pointed it out, Harry wouldn°Øt have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn°Øt glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn°Øt see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside. For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, °∞The usual, Hagrid?°± DIAGON ALLEY .. 69 .. °∞Can°Øt, Tom, I°Øm on Hogwarts business,°± said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry°Øs shoulder and making Harry°Øs knees buckle. °∞Good Lord,°± said the bartender, peering at Harry, °∞is this °™ can this be °™ ?°± The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent. °∞Bless my soul,°± whispered the old bartender, °∞Harry Potter . . . what an honor.°± He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes. °∞Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.°± Harry didn°Øt know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming. Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron. °∞Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can°Øt believe I°Øm meeting you at last.°± °∞So proud, Mr. Potter, I°Øm just so proud.°± °∞Always wanted to shake your hand °™ I°Øm all of a flutter.°± °∞Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can°Øt tell you, Diggle°Øs the name, Dedalus Diggle.°± °∞I°Øve seen you before!°± said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle°Øs top hat fell off in his excitement. °∞You bowed to me once in a shop.°± °∞He remembers!°± cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. °∞Did you hear that? He remembers me!°± CHAPTER FIVE .. 70 .. Harry shook hands again and again °™ Doris Crockford kept coming back for more. A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was twitching. °∞Professor Quirrell!°± said Hagrid. °∞Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.°± °∞P-P-Potter,°± stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry°Øs hand, °∞c-can°Øt t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.°± °∞What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?°± °∞D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,°± muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he°Ød rather not think about it. °∞N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?°± He laughed nervously. °∞You°Øll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I°Øve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires, m-myself.°± He looked terrified at the very thought. But the others wouldn°Øt let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble. °∞Must get on °™ lots ter buy Come on, Harry.°± Doris Crockford shook Harry°Øs hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds. Hagrid grinned at Harry. °∞Told yeh, didn°Øt I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin°Ø ter meet yeh °™ mind you, he°Øs usually tremblin°Ø.°± °∞Is he always that nervous?°± °∞Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was DIAGON ALLEY .. 71 .. studyin°Ø outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o°Ø trouble with a hag °™ never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject °™ now, where°Øs me umbrella?°± Vampires? Hags? Harry°Øs head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can. °∞Three up . . . two across . . .°± he muttered. °∞Right, stand back, Harry.°± He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella. The brick he had touched quivered °™ it wriggled °™ in the middle, a small hole appeared °™ it grew wider and wider °™ a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight. °∞Welcome,°± said Hagrid, °∞to Diagon Alley.°± He grinned at Harry°Øs amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall. The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons °™ All Sizes °™ Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver °™ Self-Stirring °™ Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them. °∞Yeah, you°Øll be needin°Ø one,°± said Hagrid, °∞but we gotta get yer money first.°± Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was CHAPTER FIVE .. 72 .. shaking her head as they passed, saying, °∞Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they°Øre mad. A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium °™ Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry°Øs age had their noses pressed against a window with broomsticks in it. °∞Look,°± Harry heard one of them say, °∞the new Nimbus Two Thousand °™ fastest ever °™°± There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels°Ø eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . . °∞Gringotts,°± said Hagrid. They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was °™ °∞Yeah, that°Øs a goblin,°± said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this time, with words engraved upon them: Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours, DIAGON ALLEY .. 73 .. Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there. °∞Like I said, yeh°Ød be mad ter try an°Ø rob it,°± said Hagrid. A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter. °∞Morning,°± said Hagrid to a free goblin. °∞We°Øve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter°Øs safe.°± °∞You have his key, sir?°± °∞Got it here somewhere,°± said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals. °∞Got it,°± said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key. The goblin looked at it closely. °∞That seems to be in order.°± °∞An°Ø I°Øve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,°± said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. °∞It°Øs about the You- Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.°± The goblin read the letter carefully. °∞Very well,°± he said, handing it back to Hagrid, °∞I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!°± Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed CHAPTER FIVE .. 74 .. all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall. °∞What°Øs the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?°± Harry asked. °∞Can°Øt tell yeh that,°± said Hagrid mysteriously. °∞Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore°Øs trusted me. More°Øn my job°Øs worth ter tell yeh that.°± Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in °™ Hagrid with some difficulty °™ and were off. At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn°Øt steering. Harry°Øs eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late °™ they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. °∞I never know,°± Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, °∞what°Øs the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?°± °∞Stalagmite°Øs got an °Æm°Ø in it,°± said Hagrid. °∞An°Ø don°Ø ask me questions just now, I think I°Øm gonna be sick.°± DIAGON ALLEY .. 75 .. He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling. Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. °∞All yours,°± smiled Hagrid. All Harry°Øs °™ it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn°Øt have known about this or they°Ød have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under London. Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. °∞The gold ones are Galleons,°± he explained. °∞Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it°Øs easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o°Ø terms, we°Øll keep the rest safe for yeh.°± He turned to Griphook. °∞Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?°± °∞One speed only,°± said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. °∞Stand back,°± said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. CHAPTER FIVE .. 76 .. °∞If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they°Ød be sucked through the door and trapped in there,°± said Griphook. °∞How often do you check to see if anyone°Øs inside?°± Harry asked. °∞About once every ten years,°± said Griphook with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least °™ but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. °∞Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don°Øt talk to me on the way back, its best if I keep me mouth shut,°± said Hagrid. One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn°Øt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn°Øt have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he°Ød had in his whole life °™ more money than even Dudley had ever had. °∞Might as well get yer uniform,°± said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin°Øs Robes for All Occasions. °∞Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.°± He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin°Øs shop alone, feeling nervous. Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. DIAGON ALLEY .. 77 .. °∞Hogwarts, dear?°± she said, when Harry started to speak. °∞Got the lot here °™ another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.°± In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right length. °∞Hello,°± said the boy, °∞Hogwarts, too?°± °∞Yes,°± said Harry. °∞My father°Øs next door buying my books and mother°Øs up the street looking at wands,°± said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. °∞Then I°Øm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don°Øt see why first years can°Øt have their own. I think I°Øll bully father into getting me one and I°Øll smuggle it in somehow.°± Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. °∞Have you got your own broom?°± the boy went on. °∞No,°± said Harry. °∞Play Quidditch at all?°± °∞No,°± Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. °∞I do °™ Father says it°Øs a crime if I°Øm not picked to play for my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you°Øll be in yet?°± °∞No,°± said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. °∞Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I°Øll be in Slytherin, all our family have been °™ imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I°Ød leave, wouldn°Øt you?°± CHAPTER FIVE .. 78 .. °∞Mmm,°± said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. °∞I say, look at that man!°± said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn°Øt come in. °∞That°Øs Hagrid,°± said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn°Øt. °∞He works at Hogwarts.°± °∞Oh,°± said the boy, °∞I°Øve heard of him. He°Øs a sort of servant, isn°Øt he?°± °∞He°Øs the gamekeeper,°± said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. °∞Yes, exactly. I heard he°Øs a sort of savage °™ lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.°± °∞I think he°Øs brilliant,°± said Harry coldly. °∞Do you?°± said the boy, with a slight sneer. °∞Why is he with you? Where are your parents?°± °∞They°Øre dead,°± said Harry shortly. He didn°Øt feel much like going into the matter with this boy. °∞Oh, sorry,°± said the other, not sounding sorry at all. °∞But they were our kind, weren°Øt they?°± °∞They were a witch and wizard, if that°Øs what you mean.°± °∞I really don°Øt think they should let the other sort in, do you? They°Øre just not the same, they°Øve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What°Øs your surname, anyway?°± But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, °∞That°Øs DIAGON ALLEY .. 79 .. you done, my dear,°± and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. °∞Well, I°Øll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,°± said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). °∞What°Øs up?°± said Hagrid. °∞Nothing,°± Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, °∞Hagrid, what°Øs Quidditch?°± °∞Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin°Ø how little yeh know °™ not knowin°Ø about Quidditch!°± °∞Don°Øt make me feel worse,°± said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin°Øs. °∞°™ and he said people from Muggle families shouldn°Øt even be allowed in °™°± °∞Yer not from a Muggle family. If he°Ød known who yeh were °™ he°Øs grown up knowin°Ø yer name if his parents are wizardin°Ø folk. You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o°Ø the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in °Øem in a long line o°Ø Muggles °™ look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!°± °∞So what is Quidditch?°± °∞It°Øs our sport. Wizard sport. It°Øs like °™ like soccer in the Muggle world °™ everyone follows Quidditch °™ played up in the air on broomsticks and there°Øs four balls °™ sorta hard ter explain the rules.°± CHAPTER FIVE .. 80 .. °∞And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?°± °∞School Houses. There°Øs four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o°Ø duffers, but °™°± °∞I bet I°Øm in Hufflepuff,°± said Harry gloomily. °∞Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,°± said Hagrid darkly. °∞There°Øs not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn°Øt in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.°± °∞Vol-, sorry °™ You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?°± °∞Years an°Ø years ago,°± said Hagrid. They bought Harry°Øs school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. °∞I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.°± °∞I°Øm not sayin°Ø that°Øs not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,°± said Hagrid. °∞An°Ø anyway, yeh couldn°Ø work any of them curses yet, yeh°Øll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.°± Hagrid wouldn°Øt let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (°∞It says pewter on yer list°±), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up DIAGON ALLEY .. 81 .. for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop). Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry°Øs list again. °∞Just yer wand left °™ oh yeah, an°Ø I still haven°Øt got yeh a birthday present.°± Harry felt himself go red. °∞You don°Øt have to °™°± °∞I know I don°Øt have to. Tell yeh what, I°Øll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh°Ød be laughed at °™ an°Ø I don°Ø like cats, they make me sneeze. I°Øll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they°Øre dead useful, carry yer mail an°Ø everythin°Ø.°± Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn°Øt stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. °∞Don°Ø mention it,°± said Hagrid gruffly. °∞Don°Ø expect you°Øve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now °™ only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.°± A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. CHAPTER FIVE .. 82 .. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. °∞Good afternoon,°± said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. °∞Hello,°± said Harry awkwardly. °∞Ah yes,°± said the man. °∞Yes, yes. I thought I°Ød be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.°± It wasn°Øt a question. °∞You have your mother°Øs eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.°± Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. °∞Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it °™ it°Øs really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.°± DIAGON ALLEY .. 83 .. Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. °∞And that°Øs where . . .°± Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry°Øs forehead with a long, white finger. °∞I°Øm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,°± he said softly. °∞Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I°Ød known what that wand was going out into the world to do. . . .°± He shook his head and then, to Harry°Øs relief, spotted Hagrid. °∞Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn°Øt it?°± °∞It was, sir, yes,°± said Hagrid. °∞Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?°± said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern. °∞Er °™ yes, they did, yes,°± said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. °∞I°Øve still got the pieces, though,°± he added brightly. °∞But you don°Øt use them?°± said Mr. Ollivander sharply. °∞Oh, no, sir,°± said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. °∞Hmmm,°± said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. °∞Well, now °™ Mr. Potter. Let me see.°± He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. °∞Which is your wand arm?°± °∞Er °™ well, I°Øm right-handed,°± said Harry. °∞Hold out your arm. That°Øs it.°± He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, °∞Every Ollivander CHAPTER FIVE .. 84 .. wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard°Øs wand.°± Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. °∞That will do,°± he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. °∞Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.°± Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. °∞Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try °™°± Harry tried °™ but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander. °∞No, no °™ here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.°± Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. °∞Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we°Øll find the perfect match here somewhere °™ I wonder, now °™ yes, why not °™ unusual combination °™ holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.°± DIAGON ALLEY .. 85 .. Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, °∞Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how curious . . . how very curious . . .°± He put Harry°Øs wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, °∞Curious . . . curious . . .°± °∞Sorry,°± said Harry, °∞but what°Øs curious?°± Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. °∞I remember every wand I°Øve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather °™ just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother °™ why, its brother gave you that scar.°± Harry swallowed. °∞Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things °™ terrible, yes, but great.°± Harry shivered. He wasn°Øt sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop. The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, CHAPTER FIVE .. 86 .. back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty Harry didn°Øt speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn°Øt even notice how much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry°Øs lap. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder. °∞Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,°± he said. He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow. °∞You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,°± said Hagrid. Harry wasn°Øt sure he could explain. He°Ød just had the best birthday of his life °™ and yet °™ he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words. °∞Everyone thinks I°Øm special,°± he said at last. °∞All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don°Øt know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I°Øm famous and I can°Øt even remember what I°Øm famous for. I don°Øt know what happened when Vol-, sorry °™ I mean, the night my parents died.°± Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile. °∞Don°Ø you worry, Harry. You°Øll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you°Øll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it°Øs hard. Yeh°Øve been singled out, an°Ø that°Øs always hard. But yeh°Øll have a great time at Hogwarts °™ I did °™ still do, °Øsmatter of fact.°± DIAGON ALLEY .. 87 .. Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope. °∞Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,°± he said. °∞First o°Ø September °™ King°Øs Cross °™ it°Øs all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she°Øll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.°± The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone. C H A P T E R S I X .. 88 .. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS arry°Øs last month with the Dursleys wasn°Øt fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn°Øt stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn°Øt shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him °™ in fact, they didn°Øt speak to him at all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while. Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn°Øt come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry ticked off H THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS .. 89 .. another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first. On the last day of August he thought he°Ød better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King°Øs Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room. °∞Er °™ Uncle Vernon?°± Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening. °∞Er °™ I need to be at King°Øs Cross tomorrow to °™ to go to Hogwarts.°± Uncle Vernon grunted again. °∞Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?°± Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes. °∞Thank you.°± He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke. °∞Funny way to get to a wizards°Ø school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?°± Harry didn°Øt say anything. °∞Where is this school, anyway?°± °∞I don°Øt know,°± said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket. °∞I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o°Øclock,°± he read. His aunt and uncle stared. °∞Platform what?°± °∞Nine and three-quarters.°± CHAPTER SIX .. 90 .. °∞Don°Øt talk rubbish,°± said Uncle Vernon. °∞There is no platform nine and three-quarters.°± °∞Its on my ticket.°± °∞Barking,°± said Uncle Vernon, °∞howling mad, the lot of them. You°Øll see. You just wait. All right, we°Øll take you to King°Øs Cross. We°Øre going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn°Øt bother.°± °∞Why are you going to London?°± Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly. °∞Taking Dudley to the hospital,°± growled Uncle Vernon. °∞Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.°± Harry woke at five o°Øclock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn°Øt want to walk into the station in his wizard°Øs robes °™ he°Ød change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry°Øs huge, heavy trunk had been loaded into the Dursleys°Ø car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off. They reached King°Øs Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry°Øs trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face. °∞Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine °™ platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don°Øt seem to have built it yet, do they?°± THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS .. 91 .. He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all. °∞Have a good term,°± said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry°Øs mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He°Ød have to ask someone. He stopped a passing guard, but didn°Øt dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn°Øt even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o°Øclock, but the guard said there wasn°Øt one. In the end the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl. Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector°Øs stand between platforms nine and ten. At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying. °∞°™ packed with Muggles, of course °™°± CHAPTER SIX .. 92 .. Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry°Øs in front of him °™ and they had an owl. Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were saying. °∞Now, what°Øs the platform number?°± said the boys°Ø mother. °∞Nine and three-quarters!°± piped a small girl, also red-headed, who was holding her hand, °∞Mom, can°Øt I go . . .°± °∞You°Øre not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.°± What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it °™ but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had vanished. °∞Fred, you next,°± the plump woman said. °∞I°Øm not Fred, I°Øm George,°± said the boy. °∞Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can°Øt you tell I°Øm George?°± °∞Sorry, George, dear.°± °∞Only joking, I am Fred,°± said the boy, and off he went. His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone °™ but how had he done it? Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier °™ he was almost there °™ and then, quite suddenly, he wasn°Øt anywhere. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS .. 93 .. There was nothing else for it. °∞Excuse me,°± Harry said to the plump woman. °∞Hello, dear,°± she said. °∞First time at Hogwarts? Ron°Øs new, too.°± She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long nose. °∞Yes,°± said Harry. °∞The thing is °™ the thing is, I don°Øt know how to °™°± °∞How to get onto the platform?°± she said kindly, and Harry nodded. °∞Not to worry,°± she said. °∞All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don°Øt stop and don°Øt be scared you°Øll crash into it, that°Øs very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you°Øre nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.°± °∞Er °™ okay,°± said Harry. He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked very solid. He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to smash right into that barrier and then he°Ød be in trouble °™ leaning forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run °™ the barrier was coming nearer and nearer °™ he wouldn°Øt be able to stop °™ the cart was out of control °™ he was a foot away °™ he closed his eyes ready for the crash °™ It didn°Øt come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes. A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o°Øclock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway CHAPTER SIX .. 94 .. where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it. Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks. The first few carriages were already packed with students, some hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, °∞Gran, I°Øve lost my toad again.°± °∞Oh, Neville,°± he heard the old woman sigh. A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd. °∞Give us a look, Lee, go on.°± The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg. Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot. °∞Want a hand?°± It was one of the red-haired twins he°Ød followed through the barrier. °∞Yes, please,°± Harry panted. °∞Oy, Fred! C°Ømere and help!°± With the twins°Ø help, Harry°Øs trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment. THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS .. 95 .. °∞Thanks,°± said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out of his eyes. °∞What°Øs that?°± said one of the twins suddenly, pointing at Harry°Øs lightning scar. °∞Blimey,°± said the other twin. °∞Are you °™ ?°± °∞He is,°± said the first twin. °∞Aren°Øt you?°± he added to Harry. °∞What?°± said Harry. °∞Harry Potter,°± chorused the twins. °∞Oh, him,°± said Harry. °∞I mean, yes, I am.°± The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train°Øs open door. °∞Fred? George? Are you there?°± °∞Coming, Mom.°± With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train. Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief. °∞Ron, you°Øve got something on your nose.°± The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing the end of his nose. °∞Mom °™ geroff.°± He wriggled free. °∞Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?°± said one of the twins. °∞Shut up,°± said Ron. °∞Where°Øs Percy?°± said their mother. °∞He°Øs coming now.°± The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed CHAPTER SIX .. 96 .. into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it. °∞Can°Øt stay long, Mother,°± he said. °∞I°Øm up front, the prefects have got two compartments to themselves °™°± °∞Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?°± said one of the twins, with an air of great surprise. °∞You should have said something, we had no idea.°± °∞Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,°± said the other twin. °∞Once °™°± °∞Or twice °™°± °∞A minute °™°± °∞All summer °™°± °∞Oh, shut up,°± said Percy the Prefect. °∞How come Percy gets new robes,
